      <description>In the last post about Botejão, my Telegram Menu Bot, I discussed a feature I would like to add to it: allow the user to see how many people are in the restaurants line.
I also mentioned that the university itself would only install and allow the use of the camera if the processing was done on-device and the images never left it. The only output would be how many people are in the line, through an API, for privacy reasons.</description>

      <description>When learning Rust I started many toy projects. One of them was Botejão.
It was never meant to be anything more than a Telegram Bot to check my universities (UNICAMP) daily menu. In the beginning users asked the bot for the menu and then got a reply.
Later it got a few upgrades and now it sends the day&amp;rsquo;s menu every night to a channel.
However, I always felt like this bot could do more.</description>
