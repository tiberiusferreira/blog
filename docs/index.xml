      <description>Why do it? Well, there is certainly a gap in the ecosystem currently and at least some people are interested.
In theory, Rust can do whatever C/C++ does given enough effort. Since most of Pytorch/Tensorflow is C++/CUDA, at least the C++ part should be doable.
Also, I&amp;rsquo;m too naive to not try it, but as alluded in a previous post I&amp;rsquo;m aware that it might not be so easy to follow Rust&amp;rsquo;s ownership and borrowing rules while providing similar ergonomics as Pytorch.</description>

      <description>How I got involved After experimenting with Yolo for an university project I got really curious and excited about the whole computer vision field, and since most of it now based on deep convolutional networks I started reading up on them.
This quickly lead me to two fields: Tensorflow and Pytorch, both built to be used through the Python API. I followed some tutorials from Pytorch&amp;rsquo;s official website and took some classes from Fast.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while and a lot happened since the last time.
The plan with this post was to show the results of optimizing Yolo&amp;rsquo;s hot path for the Raspberry Pi 3B+
I did get into Yolo&amp;rsquo;s codebase and did some profiling. Turns out, most (85%+) of the time was spent in a single function.
Which is great news, we can focus our optimization efforts!
The weird named function didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be doing much:</description>

      <description>In the last post about Botejão, my Telegram Menu Bot, I discussed a feature I would like to add to it: allow the user to see how many people are in the restaurants line.
I also mentioned that the university itself would only install and allow the use of the camera if the processing was done on-device and the images never left it. The only output would be how many people are in the line, through an API, for privacy reasons.</description>

      <title>Botejão - An excuse to write Rust</title>

      <description>When learning Rust I started many toy projects. One of them was Botejão.
It was never meant to be anything more than a Telegram Bot to check my universities (UNICAMP) daily menu. In the beginning users asked the bot for the menu and then got a reply.
Later it got a few upgrades and now it sends the day&amp;rsquo;s menu every night to a channel.
However, I always felt like this bot could do more.</description>
